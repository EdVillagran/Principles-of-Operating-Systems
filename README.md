# Principles-of-Operating-Systems
Course work for CSCI 480 Principles of Operating Systems(Spring 2020) written in C++ and C.
* Course Objective: </br>
  <t>Principles and practices of modern operating system design. Includes file systems organization; memory management; multitasking; windowing interfaces; interprocess communication, including communications across a network; and client-server models of processing.

## Assignment 1 </br>

Program Summary: This program is designed to test several functions
  such as fork(), getpid(), getppid(), sleep(),
  wait(), and system().

## Assignment 2 </br>

Program Summary: The purpose of this assignment
  is to have 3 processes communicate with each other
  using pipes. To create the 3 porcess I will use 
  fork() and have a parent, child, grandchild process.
  Parent reads from child who reads from grandchild
  who reads from parent. 

## Assignment 3 </br>

Program Summary: We are to create a microshell
  simulator that is capable of running commands.
  It should reconize '>+' & '<+' as the redirect
  command origionally > & <.

## Assignment 4 </br>

Program Summary: We are to create a virtual
  memory simulation and using FIFO and Demand Paging alogorithms for
  page replacement. 

## Assignment 4 </br>

Program Summary: Use POSIX thread, Semaphores 
  and a mutex to simulate the producer/consumer 
 problem.
